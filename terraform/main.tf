# GCS backend configuration has the following key-value pairs.

# Bucket: Google storage bucket name. previously created GCS bucket name
# Prefix: Folders inside the bucket.  TF will create this folder path inside provided bucket name above
# Credentials: Path to google service account file. It's mandatory because it has to access existing GCS on GCP 

# the reason credentials are needed in both the backend configuration and the provider block is because they serve different purposes 
# and are used in different parts of the Terraform process:

# Backend Configuration Credentials: Used to authenticate Terraform when interacting with the backend storage where your state files are stored.
# Provider Block Credentials: Used to authenticate Terraform with the cloud provider's APIs to manage resources within your cloud environment.
# Each set of credentials ensures that Terraform can perform its specific tasks securely and with the necessary permissions.
